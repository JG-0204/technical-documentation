# Technical Documentation

## Description

A project in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). It was to build a technical documentation page to serve as instruction or reference for a topic.

The topic I chose is HTML Basics from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).
