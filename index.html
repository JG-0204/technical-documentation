               <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
               <p>
                  HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
                  content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use
                  to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it
                  appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags
                  can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
                  italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
                  on. For example, take the following line of content:
               </p>
               <pre>
                  <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
               </pre>
               <p>
                  If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify
                  that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
               </p>
               <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
               <h2>Nesting elements</h2>
               <p>
                  You can put elements inside other elements too — this is
                  called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very
                  grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt;
                  element, which means that the word is to be strongly
                  emphasized:
               </p>
               <code>
                  &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
                  grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
               </code>
               <p>
                  You do however need to make sure that your elements are
                  properly nested. In the example above, we opened the &lt;p&gt;
                  element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we
                  have to close the &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the
                  &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:
               </p>
               <code>
                  &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very
                  grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code
               >
               <p>
                  The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are
                  clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as
                  shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best
                  guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to
                  unexpected results. So don't do it!
               </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Void_elements">
               <h2>Void elements</h2>
               <p>
                  Some elements have no content and are called void elements.
                  Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have in our HTML
                  page:
               </p>
               <code
                  >&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"
                  /></code
               >
               <p>
                  This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
                  &lt;/img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is because an
                  image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose
                  is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document">
               <h2>Anatomy of an HTML document</h2>
               <p>
                  That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they
                  aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual
                  elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's look
                  at this html file.
               </p>
               <pre>
                  <code>
                     &lt;!doctype html&gt; 
                     &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt; 
                        &lt;head&gt;
                           &lt;meta charset="utf-8" />
                           &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
                           &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
                        &lt;/head&gt;
                        &lt;body&gt;
                           &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                     &lt;/html&gt;
                  </code>
               </pre>
               <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
               <ul class="tag-list">
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> — doctype. It is
                        a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was
                        young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as
                        links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow
                        to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
                        error checking and other useful things. However, these
                        days, they don't do much and are basically just needed
                        to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all
                        you need to know for now.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</strong> — the
                        &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content
                        on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root
                        element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting
                        the primary language of the document.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</strong> — the
                        &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container
                        for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page
                        that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
                        viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page
                        description that you want to appear in search results,
                        CSS to style our content, character set declarations,
                        and more.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong> — This
                        element sets the character set your document should use
                        to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast
                        majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now
                        handle any textual content you might put on it. There is
                        no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some
                        problems later on.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong
                           >&lt;meta name="viewport"
                           content="width=device-width"&gt;</strong
                        >
                        — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the
                        width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from
                        rendering pages wider than the viewport and then
                        shrinking them down.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</strong> — the
                        &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page,
                        which is the title that appears in the browser tab the
                        page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page
                        when you bookmark/favorite it.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>
                        <strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong> — the
                        &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that
                        you want to show to web users when they visit your page,
                        whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable
                        audio tracks, or whatever else.
